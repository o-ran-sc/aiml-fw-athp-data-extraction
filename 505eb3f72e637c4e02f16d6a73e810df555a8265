Is it fine to assign `1` to partition_key?\n\n[*The two measures of partition size are the number of values in a partition and partition size on disk. Though requirements for these measures may vary based on the application a general guideline is to keep number of values per partition to below 100,000 and disk space per partition to below 100MB.*](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/data_modeling/intro.html#data-model-analysis)",

      "message": "I agree with that putting all the data into a single partition is not good.\n\nI have considered partitioning the data by date. However, the problem is that Cassandra does not support sorting data by time within a partition. For example, after the last entry of the 2023-09-05 partition, the first entry of the 2023-10-04 partition could suddenly appear. In such cases, sorting the data would have to be done at the feature_store_sdk stage.\n\nWhat do you think about using InfluxDB for cases where the time order is important, and using Cassandra for other cases?",
